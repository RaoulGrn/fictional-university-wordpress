### About the project

# I made this project along side a tutorial from Udemy with the purpose to learn more about Wordpress
and PHP (a little javascript also) and the interactions between the admin dashboard and creating a theme from scratch in php.
I used Local by Flywheel for the setup.

## Functionalities

# You can make and account and check the fictional university's majors, the related professors for each major, users can like the professors,
there also is a map with the university's campuses locations (gmap API was used).
The site benefits from a live search implementation, if you press 's' the live search overlay will appear.
Also, users can create private notes that only they can see. They can create posts.
Furthermore, I've included some basic "Events" that every university has during their year.
